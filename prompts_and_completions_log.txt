I have a local git repository from my project.  
I committed some files to this local repository, now i want to commit my changesto github.com

I created a github.com reposirity named git_github_lessons to share my project with my team. I uploaded the folder with the files for the project.
I used github desktop to open the github.com repository.
I opened vscode from github desktop.
I renamed the folder with underscores instead of hyphens.
Then i commited my changes.
Ask me clarifying questions to make sure you understand my requests clearly.



1. What is the structure of the project in your `git_github_lessons` repository? Could you provide a brief description of the main files and their purpose?
 Q1-A1 I am building a file renamer tool.
 Q1-A2 To learn git and github commands and workflow. I am using the file rename as my learning vehicle.


2. When you say you "renamed the folder with underscores instead of hyphens", do you mean you renamed the folder on your local machine, or did you make this change directly on GitHub?
Q2-A1 I made the changes on my local machine


3. After renaming the folder, did you encounter any issues when committing your changes?
Q3-A1 No Issues


4. Are there any specific tasks you need assistance with related to this repository or your project?
Q4-A1  What do I do next to share these changes with others?
